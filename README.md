# OnlineCalculator

This is an online webpage calculator, optimized for mobile but functional on all screens and browsers.

Inputting a calculation logs the results as they happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the website.

Currently runs by using a local Node.js instance, which can be then connected to the internet using localtunnel.
